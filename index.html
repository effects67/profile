        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a first year web developer currently enrolled at Bellevue University. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            I have been able to apply my skills to create web pages and prototypes. With only a few months of instruction,
            I have learned so much and continue to expand my knowledge in web development.
        </p>
 
        </br>
        <p>In addition to my coursework, I follow web projects on GitHub and other open source materials to 
        attain a better grasp on these subjects. Web development is an ever expanding field of expertise and in 
        order to remain up-to-date, developers must always maintain a presence in the evolution of the web. 
        As a web developer, I strive not only to understand the foundations of web development, but also to
        play a role in its future.

        <p>
            Apart from coding, I'm an avid reader, pianist, and amateur conosiour of cuisine. Without the internet, I wouldn't have access to
            recipes, e-books, or sheet music. I love the vast available resources on the web, which drives my motivation for learning.
            I hope to contribute to the presentation and distribution of information, services and products for a better online experience.
        </p>

            GitHub is a useful tool for sharing web designs. You can view my projects in my GitHub repository.
